# Fit-Tracker

This is the backend repo for my capstone project.

Fit-Tracker is a web app to organize workouts in a form of playlists and assign them days to easily organize user's workout's splits.

The following free API is used to gather workout information [WorkoutDB](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb/).
